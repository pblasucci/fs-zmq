fszmq
===================

fszmq is an LGPLv3-licensed F# binding for the ZeroMQ  distributed computing library. 
It provides a complete binding to versions 2.1.x, 3.2.x, and 4.0.x of ZeroMQ 
(Note: each binding is a separate branch in git, as there are some non-compatible differences). 
This library is primarily designed to be consumed from F#. However, where possible, the library has been designed 
to appear "friendly" when consumed by other CLR languages (C#, et aliam).

Getting Started
-------

The simplest thing we can do with fszmq is print the ZeroMQ version. That is, we can display the version, 
which is not fixed at compile-time, of the native library (i.e. libzmq) against which fszmq.dll is current bound.
_(Note: the version of fszmq.dll, itself, may be retrieved via the normal mechanisms for CLR libraries.)_

#r "fszmq.dll"
open fszmq

printfn "libzmq version: %A" ZMQ.version

Running this code should produce something like the following (the actual numbers may be different on your machine):

<table class="pre"><tbody><tr><td class="lines"><pre class="fssnip"><span class="l"> 1: </span>
<span class="l"> 2: </span>
<span class="l"> 3: </span></pre>
</td>
<td class="snippet"><pre class="fssnip"><span class="i">&gt;</span>
<span class="i">libzmq version: 4.0.4</span>
<span class="i">&gt;</span></pre>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>

Samples & Documentation
-----------------------

This library features API documentation, and an ever-growing collection of samples. Most of these narrative-style examples
are also executable F# scripts, and may be found in [the content folder][content] (Hint: look for files ending in `.fsx`).

In particular, please review:

 * [Client/Server Tutorial](tutorial.html) ... contains a more complete, but simplistic, example of fszmq in action.

 * [API Reference](reference/index.html) ... contains automatically generated documentation for all types, modules, 
   and functions in the library. This includes additional brief samples on using some of the functionality.

Additionally, general information about ZeroMQ maybe found at [http://zero.mq](http://zero.mq). 
And [the zguide][zguide] is a well-written, exhaustive explanation of the library. 
It should definitely be read. And then read again. Also, while the zguide features examples in many languages, 
the [F#-specific zguide code samples][zguidefs] have been [collected here as a convenience][localguide].
